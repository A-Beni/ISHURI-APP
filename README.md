# ISHURI-APP
This is a repository for an E-learning platform

To use the Ishuri app, you will need to follow a few steps to set it up on your local machine. Below is a detailed guide on how to do this:

1. Download XAMPP: XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends. You can download XAMPP from the official website [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the installation instructions.

2. Clone the Repository: Once you have XAMPP installed, you'll need to clone the Ishuri app repository to your local machine. You can do this by using Git, the version control system. If you haven't installed Git yet, you can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the installation instructions. After installing Git, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the Ishuri app repository. You can find this URL on the repository's webpage on GitHub or any other version control platform where the repository is hosted.

3. Move the Folder to XAMPP's htdocs Directory: After cloning the repository, you will have a folder containing all the files of the Ishuri app. Move this folder to the `htdocs` directory inside the XAMPP installation directory. By default, the `htdocs` directory is located in the following path:

   - Windows**: `C:\xampp\htdocs`
   - macOS**: `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs`
   - Linux**: `/opt/lampp/htdocs`

   Copy the Ishuri app folder into the `htdocs` directory.

4. Start XAMPP: Now, start XAMPP by running the XAMPP control panel application. You can usually find this in the XAMPP installation directory. Start the Apache web server by clicking on the "Start" button next to Apache in the control panel.

5. Access the Ishuri App: Once Apache is running, open a web browser and navigate to the following URL:

   ```
   http://localhost/<ishuri_app_folder_name>
   ```

   Replace `<ishuri_app_folder_name>` with the name of the folder you copied into the `htdocs` directory. This will load the Ishuri app in your web browser, and you can start using it locally on your machine.

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up and access the Ishuri app on your local machine using XAMPP.
